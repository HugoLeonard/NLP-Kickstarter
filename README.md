The main objective of this project is to use NLP sentiment analysis to predict the success of Kickstarter projects based on the project description (blurb). 

By analyzing the sentiment of the project description, we aim to gain insights into the likelihood of a project's success.

To perform the sentiment analysis, NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and machine learning algorithms will be utilized. These techniques will help to identify words used in the project description and classify them as positive or negative.
